                    <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
                    <p class="">
                        The Deck is situated on the banks of the Saigon River, a short 15 minutes journey from the heart of Ho Chi Minh City. It is the city’s most modern Pan Asian cuisine where friendships, romance and fine food comes together. Once you’ve been greeted by a smile, share the sunset, unwind with a signature cocktail and enjoy the contemporary experience it will be hard for you depart.
